    <h1>DWA Starter Vue</h1>
    <p>Decentralized Web App: it's a Web5 Progressive Web App.</p>
    <h2>Why PWA?</h2>
    <p>
      It's a perfect match with Web5 DWNs since a PWA can work offline and DWN has a synced local
      storage.

    <p>
      Aside from that, the advanced PWA capabilities such as modifying fetch requests allow us to
      extract the most such as displaying images with DRLs in the traditional `src` attribute.
