# Vue.js Decentralized Web App (DWA) Starter

Decentralized Web App: it's a Web5 Progressive Web App.

## Why PWA?

It's a perfect match with Web5 DWNs since a PWA can work offline and DWN has a synced local storage.

Aside from that, the advanced PWA capabilities such as modifying fetch requests allow us to extract the most such as displaying images with DRLs in the traditional `src` attribute.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16.x or higher recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (preferred for fast package management)

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dwa-starter-vue.git
```

```bash
cd dwa-starter-vue
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required packages with pnpm.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Step 3: Run the Development Server

Start the development server and hot-reload the project.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Alternatively, you can run the development server with:

```bash
pnpm run start
```

### Step 4: Build for Production

To compile and minify the project for production, run:

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Step 5: Run Unit and End-to-End Tests

#### Unit Tests with Vitest

Run the unit tests using Vitest.

```bash
pnpm test:unit
```

#### End-to-End Tests with Playwright

Ensure Playwright is installed, then run your end-to-end tests.

```bash
npx playwright install
```

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

You can also run tests specific to a browser or test file:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e --project=chromium
```

```bash
pnpm test:e2e tests/example.spec.ts
```

### Step 6: Linting

Run the linter to catch and fix common issues:

```bash
pnpm lint
```
