**Note**

- Everything written within the body of the function will be extracted and added to a `code-snippets-map.json` file. These are not executable, they are only to be used for content.
- `return` statements are excluded from being shown, however, we still need them for testing purposes
- For situations where it doesn't make sense to return anything, we will exclude them from being tested

### **Remember**

Adhere to the project's coding standards and guidelines. Before submitting your contribution, ensure all tests pass and your code is well-documented.
